# slither mod

`script-src.js` is the actual mod code, `tampermonkey-script.js` is what you
put in Tampermonkey. For development, you'll need to point to either your own Github
in `tampermonkey-script.js` or just copy the content of `script-src.js` into Tampermonkey,
remembering to keep it up to date with your local copy.

The rest is the Angular app.
